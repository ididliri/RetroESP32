One of the most impressive aspects of Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain v1 only is its dynamic and realistic world. The game takes place in two large open-world maps: Afghanistan and Africa. Each map has its own weather system, day and night cycle, wildlife, and terrain. The game also simulates the behavior and movement of enemy soldiers and vehicles, as well as the consequences of your actions. For example, if you destroy an enemy base, it will affect their morale and resources. If you kill too many enemies, they will become more alert and aggressive. If you leave behind traces of your presence, such as footprints or blood stains, they will follow them and find you.
  
The game also gives you a lot of freedom and options to complete your missions. You can use various tools and gadgets, such as binoculars, drones, balloons, decoys, and more. You can also call in support from your base, such as air strikes, supply drops, or reinforcements. You can also ride on horses, motorcycles, jeeps, tanks, and helicopters. You can even capture and tame wild animals, such as wolves, bears, and sheep. You can also recruit enemy soldiers by knocking them out and extracting them with balloons. You can then assign them to different units in your base, such as combat, intel, medical, or research.
  
The game also features a base-building system that allows you to expand and customize your own private army. You can construct various facilities and platforms, such as command center, R&D lab, armory, hospital, and more. You can also decorate your base with posters, flags, music speakers, and other items. You can also visit your base at any time and interact with your staff and animals. You can also invite other players to visit your base or invade theirs in a mode called FOB (Forward Operating Base). In this mode, you can either defend your base from intruders or infiltrate theirs and steal their resources and staff.
