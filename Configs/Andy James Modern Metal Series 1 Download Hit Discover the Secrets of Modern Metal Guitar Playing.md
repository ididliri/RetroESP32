# Andy James Modern Metal Series 1 Download Hit: A Review
 
If you are a fan of metal guitar playing, you might have heard of Andy James, a British shredder who has released several solo albums and instructional DVDs. He is also known for his collaborations with other artists, such as Chimp Spanner and Alex Lustig. One of his latest projects is the Modern Metal Series, a collection of downloadable tracks that showcase his skills and versatility in different metal subgenres.
 
The first installment of the series, Modern Metal Series 1, was released in 2019 and features 10 tracks that range from folk metal to death metal. The tracks are all instrumental and feature Andy James on guitar, bass and drums, as well as guest appearances by Chimp Spanner on piano and Alex Lustig on synth. The tracks are well-produced and mixed, with clear and powerful sound quality. The guitar playing is impressive and expressive, with fast riffs, melodic solos and catchy hooks. The tracks are also varied and interesting, with different tempos, moods and influences.

Some of the highlights of the album are:
 
- "The Storm" - a folk metal track that starts with a Celtic-inspired melody and then transitions into a heavy riff with double bass drums. The track features a guest solo by Chimp Spanner on piano, which adds a nice contrast to the guitar.
- "The Void" - a progressive metal track that has a dark and atmospheric vibe. The track features a guest synth by Alex Lustig, which creates a futuristic and sci-fi sound. The track also has some djent elements, with syncopated riffs and low-tuned guitars.
- "The End" - a death metal track that is fast and brutal. The track features some blast beats, tremolo picking and guttural vocals (by Andy James himself). The track also has some melodic parts, with harmonized guitars and clean vocals.

The Modern Metal Series 1 Download Hit is a great album for metal fans who want to hear some amazing guitar playing and explore different metal styles.
