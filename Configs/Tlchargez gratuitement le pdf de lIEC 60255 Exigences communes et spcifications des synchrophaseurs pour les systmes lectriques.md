IEC 60255 standards are essential for ensuring the safety, reliability, and efficiency of power systems. They provide the technical specifications and guidelines for designing, testing, and operating measuring relays and protection equipment. They also facilitate the interoperability and compatibility of different devices and systems.
 
Some of the most widely used IEC 60255 standards are:

- IEC 60255-1: Measuring relays and protection equipment â Part 1: Common requirements. This standard specifies the general rules and requirements applicable to all measuring relays and protection equipment, such as definitions, classification, marking, documentation, environmental conditions, insulation, dielectric tests, accuracy, performance, and type tests.
- IEC 60255-118-1: Measuring relays and protection equipment â Part 118-1: Synchrophasor for power systems â Measurements. This standard specifies the requirements and tests for synchrophasor measurement devices that measure and report the voltage and current phasors in power systems. It covers the definitions, input and output quantities, measurement algorithms, accuracy classes, reporting rates, time synchronization, data formats, and communication protocols.
- IEC 60255-151: Measuring relays and protection equipment â Part 151: Functional requirements for over/under voltage protection. This standard specifies the functional requirements for measuring relays and protection equipment that provide over/under voltage protection for power systems. It covers the definitions, characteristics, settings, functions, performance criteria, and test methods.
